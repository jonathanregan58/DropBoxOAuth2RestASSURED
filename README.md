# DropBoxOAuth2RestASSURED

I tried implementing OAuth 2.0 implementation on Dropbox with RestAssured from this tutorial:

16. RestAssured || Handling OAuth 2.0 Authentication.

The difference is that on Dropbox documentation for developers(https://www.dropbox.com/developers/documentation/http/documentation), you can generate authorization key/token after you create an app on Dropbox for developers. You don't need to open browser and login to get get authorization key/token
